# Workplace Absenteeism Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting employee absenteeism to enhance workplace productivity and optimize resource allocation. The project combines data preprocessing, machine learning, deployment, and visualization techniques using Python, and Tableau.

## Project Overview

### Business Problem
In today's competitive business environment, absenteeism can disrupt workflows and lower productivity. The goal of this project is to predict how many hours an employee might be absent from work based on various factors, such as:
- Distance from workplace
- Number of children and pets
- Education level

This prediction allows companies to reorganize tasks and address potential productivity gaps proactively.

### Tools Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
- **SQL**: To manage and prepare data.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing the analysis results. View the Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/antonio.quaresma/viz/AbsenteeismPredictions_17347956070900/ReasonsvsProbability).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and organizing the raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
- Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Development
- Applying logistic regression to create the **absenteeism_module** for predicting absenteeism based on employee characteristics.

### 3. Deployment
- Deploying the **absenteeism_module** to predict absenteeism for new data inputs.

### 4. Visualization and Analysis
- Using Tableau to analyze and visualize predicted outputs.
- The dashboard provides insights into reasons for absenteeism and their likelihood.

## Dataset
The dataset (Absenteeism_data) used in this project is based on a real-world study of absenteeism at work. It represents secondary data requiring preprocessing before use.

## Insights from Tableau
The Tableau dashboard provides an intuitive visualization of the predictions, enabling businesses to:
- Understand key reasons for absenteeism.
- Anticipate and address productivity gaps.
